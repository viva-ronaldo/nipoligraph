            <p>I've made one further update to the model described in the <a href="{{url_for('blog_item', post_name='election-pred-1')}}">previous</a> <a href="{{url_for('blog_item', post_name='election-pred-2')}}">three</a> <a href="{{url_for('blog_item', post_name='election-pred-3')}}">posts</a>. A term is added to the model that divides party vote among multiple candidates, to account for the alphabetical ordering of the candidates' surnames. This has a small effect on the overall forecast, but affects the predicted chances of candidates within the same party by a perhaps surprising amount.</p>

            <p>The alphabetical ordering effect has been noted in several electoral systems in which candidates are listed alphabetically on all ballot papers, as opposed to being ordered randomly; for example, <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9248.1974.tb00018.x?journalCode=psxa'>in the Republic of Ireland</a>, and <a href='https://pprg.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/1998-impact-of-candidate-name-order-on-election-outcomes.pdf'>in the United States</a>. Crudely speaking, this bias occurs for the reason that one might guess: voters read the ballot paper from top to bottom, and if there is a pair of candidates for which they have no strong preference one way or the other, they are slightly more likely to choose (assign a higher preference to) the one they saw first. In the NI Assembly context, this occurs commonly, when a party fields two or more candidates in one constituency. Many voters will be choosing to vote for the <i>party</i>, rather than the candidate, and may not have a good reason to rank one of the candidates above the other. <a href='https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pops.12178'>It has been found</a> that the ballot ordering effect occurs most strongly when the voters have <a href='https://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/20900/4/Johnson_and_Miles_%25282011%2529.docx.pdf'>'low information'</a> on the candidates.</p>

            <p>From 2011, 2016, and 2017 Assembly election first preference vote results, we can see that the alphabetical order effect does apply. Shown below are candidate first preference vote numbers relative to the average for their party in that constituency, against their position among their party's candidates on the ballot paper. If there were no order effect, we would expect to see all of the points at <i>y=1</i>. In fact, the candidate in the first position alphabetically, among their party's candidates, receives about 10% above the party average first preference vote. In a two-candidate case in which the party receives 20% of the vote in total, this means, roughly, that the two candidates split the vote 11-9, in favour of the surname occurring first alphabetically, rather than an even 10-10 split.</p>
            
            <img class='blog-plot' src="{{url_for('static', filename='blog_plots/election-pred-alphabetical_plot1.png')}}"/>

            <p>This is the term that has been added to the NI PoliGraph model, in addition to terms for candidates having run in the previous election or having been co-opted into the seat, and the party vote split that occurred in the constituency in the previous election.</p>
            
            <p>More generally, regardless of party, being further down the ballot paper affects the number of votes a candidate receives, all other things being equal: a linear regression of number of first preference votes against ballot position shows that each position in the ballot order is worth around 40 votes, on average, or around 1.5% of the total votes in an Assembly constituency. The candidate at the bottom of a 15-person list may therefore be several hundred votes worse off than the candidates in the top few positions. The drop-off in votes with position appears to occur mainly from about position 8 onwards, suggesting a 'cognitive fatigue' effect in which voters give roughly equal attention to all candidates in the top part of the ballot, but lose interest towards the end of a long list.</p>

            <p>TODO plot for that?</p>

            <p>This <i>primacy effect</i> is a general psychological effect that has been observed in list selection in other contexts, such as <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02453.x'>taste testing</a>, <a href='https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/28548032/karmarkar%2Cshiv%2Cknutson_cost-conscious_working-paper.pdf'>evaluation of consumer goods</a>, or <a href='https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035088'>judgement of people</a>.</p>

            <p>Assuming that voters do not have any true preference for candidates with surnames near the beginning of the alphabet, this is a substantial and unfortunate penalty applying to candidates placed near the bottom of the list. For the NI Assembly Elections, the remedy for the problem seems straightforward, and that is to produce ballot papers with a randomised ordering of candidates. Although this would require some additional logistical effort at the printing stage, it seems to be a necessary step, in order to avoid the clear bias against some candidates that exists in the system at present.</p>
